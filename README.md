### 📌 Introduction
---
The Book Hoarder is a large enterprise operating several bookstores across Europe. They exclusively sell books from all genres, which could also be found in their online bookstore. However, unlike their physical stores, the company also sells e-books and audiobooks online. To promote the company & their products, The Book Hoarder frequently launched marketing campaigns in the past & has received high profits & much love from their dedicated customer base.

### ⚠️ The Problem
---
Despite continued success in their physical stores, The Book Hoarder’s online bookstore has seen a noticeable drop in their customer engagement & conversion rates over the past 2 years. This decline began after the long-standing Marketing Manager — who had led highly successful campaigns for over 25 years — retired from her position. Since the new hire took over, several digital marketing campaigns have been launched — but with disappointing results. Now, management wants the Data Analytics Team to uncover the root cause: Are the campaigns themselves inefficient, or is it the digital funnel failing to convert engaged users?

To kickstart this investigation, the Data Analytics Team must first address a critical gap in the company’s data infrastructure. Despite being a large enterprise, The Book Hoarder has never developed a centralized marketing data warehouse. The Book Hoarder currently uses a Marketing Information System (MIS) to generate campaign summaries and track internal performance. Without a centralized data warehouse, the company is unable to trace user journeys across platforms, identify drop-off points in the funnel, or measure the true ROI of their campaigns. This blind spot has made it impossible to strategically respond to the declining digital engagement. To fully diagnose the digital marketing decline, The Book Hoarder must integrate CRM data into its analytics stack. This will enable user-level funnel analysis, campaign attribution, and customer segmentation—none of which are possible with MIS alone. Before the main problem can be addressed, the Data Analytics Team must first create a data warehouse to consolidate & unify the marketing data
